# Joke Teller 😂

Welcome to the Joke Teller! This project is a fun and interactive web application that tells you jokes using text-to-speech. Built with a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it leverages modern web technologies to deliver a seamless and enjoyable user experience.

## Features ✨

- **HTML**: Provides the foundational structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Adds styling and ensures the application looks visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Adds functionality to fetch and tell jokes using text-to-speech.

## How It Works ⚙️

1. **Fetch a Joke**: The application uses an asynchronous function to call a joke API, retrieving a random joke.
2. **Text-to-Speech**: The fetched joke is then passed to a Text-to-Speech API, which vocalizes the joke for you to hear.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **HTML**: For structuring the application layout.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and ensuring a polished look.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and handling the joke fetching and text-to-speech functionality.
